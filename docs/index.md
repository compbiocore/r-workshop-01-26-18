## Goal

The purpose of this workshop, 'Fundamentals of R', is to present an overview of the R programming language and its fundamental elements to an audience with minimal coding experience.  Users will create objects, modify them, and learn how to extract descriptive information from them.  The workshop is intended to provide the foundation that will be needed to take and understand future workshops hosted by the Computational Biology Core, including the DESeq and single-cell data analysis workshops, which are all conducted in R.  Upon completing this notebook, users will be in a position to understand the more advanced concepts presented in those sessions.

## Workshop Topic Overview

In this workshop youâ€™ll learn:
- Basics of R (objects, variables, data classes, vectors)

- How to use and write R functions

- How to import and export your data

- How to install and load R and Bioconductor packages
