## Goal

The purpose of this workshop, 'Fundamentals of R', is to present an overview of the R programming language and its fundamental elements to an audience with minimal coding experience.  Users will create objects, modify them, and learn how to extract descriptive information from them.  The workshop is intended to provide the foundation that will be needed to take and understand future workshops hosted by the Computational Biology Core, including the DESeq and single-cell data analysis workshops, which are all conducted in R.  Upon completing this notebook, users will be in a position to understand the more advanced concepts presented in those sessions.

## Workshop Topic Overview

The topics presented here, in the 'Fundamentals of R' workshop, include the following:

* Basic data types (variables, vectors)
    * Numeric, character, factor
    * Vectorized operations and functions
* Dataframes and dataframe operations
    * Inspecting data
    * Exploring data, generating summary statistics
    * Combining and sorting data sets
* Extensions to base R
    * Installing new packages from CRAN and Bioconductor
    * Importing packages
* Basics of user-created functions
    * Arguments, variable scope, and return values
