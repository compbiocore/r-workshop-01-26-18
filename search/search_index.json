Users will create objects, modify them, and learn how to extract descriptive information from them. The workshop is intended to provide the foundation that will be needed to take and understand future workshops hosted by the Computational Biology Core, including the DESeq and single-cell data analysis workshops, which are all conducted in R. Upon completing this notebook, users will be in a position to understand the more advanced concepts presented in those sessions. Workshop Topic Overview In this workshop you\u2019ll learn: - Basics of R (objects, variables, data classes, vectors) How to use and write R functions How to import and export your data How to install and load R and Bioconductor packages Getting started Go to ccv.jupyter.brown.edu and login with your Brown GMail login. Once you're connected, you'll see the JupyterHub homepage: Click the 'git clone' button and paste in the URL of the git repository, which is https://github.com/compbiocore/r-workshop-1.git then click the CLONE button. Open the folder called r-workshop-1 . Open up the file called RWorkshop_JW.ipynb to launch the notebook.
